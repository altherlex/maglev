# MagLev Rakefile
#
# Currently, this Rakefile does many, but not all, of the functions in
# bin/gemstone.  Eventually, it will provide all of the functions in
# bin/gemstone, and other MagLev tasks as the need arises.
#
# Ideas for other tasks:
#
# * The rest of the tasks in bin/gemstone (topaz, ruby,...)
# * clean (remove logs etc.)
# * follow-parser: do a tail -f on the parser log
# * git support for typical workflows (see git support in Rubinius Rakefile)
# * allow command line control of the verbosity of the "sh" calls.
